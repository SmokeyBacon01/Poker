Play card games.

Debug mode allows check to see if hand detectors are working properly. If you want, you can force a particular hand by going into the main.c function and swapping draw_hand for debug_scan_hand. It accepts a string of X and O. One goes across while the other goes down first.

Currently, only Blackjack works, I'm working on a Poker implementation. Might add other card games too.
